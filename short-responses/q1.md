# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

# Teacher Feedback
Making API requests with API keys from the frontend exposes the keys to users, who could misuse them or exceed usage limits. By making API requests from the server, the API key remains hidden and secure, preventing unauthorized access.
